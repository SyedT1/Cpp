This project is about to analyse a real-time serverâ€™s transactional outbound messages which is attacked by a  spambot to send thousands of spam emails. Along with this description, a file is also provided, which consists of the actual messages sent by the spambot. 

## What is a spambot?
Speaking generally, bots are computer programs that execute repetitive tasks, and they usually operate over the Internet. A spam bot is a specific type of bot that sends (or helps with sending) spam messages. A spam bot may also post spam in various places where users interact online, such as social media platforms or forums.
Spam is any inappropriate or unwelcome message that's pushed out to a large number of users. Usually, spam involves unwanted product advertisements, irrelevant backlinks (to attempt to get the linked website higher in search engine results), or more sinister things like scams or malware downloads. Spam can also be any content that's irrelevant and delivered in large volumes.
